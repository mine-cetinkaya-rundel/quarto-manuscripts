# Reproducible authoring

## Literate programming

On the good, better, best scale:

-   good: well organized scripts separate from plain text files that contain the prose and pull in outputs of those scripts

-   better: literate programming, with code, its output, and prose intertwined in a single file

-   best: going a step further and allowing your readers to dive into the code

## Back in 2019...

## Since then...

Not many other such papers **\[TO DO: Confirm this statement\]**

# A new project type: Manuscript

## Academic writing with Quarto

-   Quarto **journal articles** (Quarto 1.2+) allow you to author journal articles with literate programming and native LaTeX templates provided by journals to create reproducible articles.

-   Quarto **manuscripts** (Quarto 1.4+), in addition to doing everything you can do with journal articles,

    -   give readers easy access to **multiple formats** through a manuscript website

    -   provide a framework for **publishing computations** alongside the manuscript, allowing readers to dive into your code

## Embed content

**\[TO DO: Add Video 5 here\]**

::: notes
Some results you want to embed, you might not want to include all of the code in your single `index.qmd` file. So you can embed from a separate `.qmd`...

Or from a separate `.ipynb`...
